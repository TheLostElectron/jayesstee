# Jayesstee User Guide

Jayesstee (pronounced J-S-T) is a library that provides a way to simply generate HTML and CSS for
HTML generation or DOM manipulation using 100% pure javascript. Its goal is not to be a framework
but instead to just be a quick tool for simple applications that require HTML generation.

By using pure javascript to create the HTML, it removes the need for extra compile-time tools and 
allows for normal javascript source level debugging while executing templates or render functions.
Using the library to generate CSS, also allows for the scoping of CSS within a module and using 
CSS templates to share pieces amongst different modules. Generating CSS is completely optional, though.
It is still completely acceptable to use external CSS.

Jayesstee can be used in node on a server to generate on-demand HTML or it can be used within the
browser to directly build and manipulate the DOM.
